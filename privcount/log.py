## Logging: Time Formatting Functions ##
## a timestamp is an absolute point in time, in seconds since unix epoch
## a period is a relative time duration, in seconds
## a time argument is either a period or a timestamp
## a desc argument is a string description of the timestamp's meaning
## All period and timestamp arguments are normalised using normalise_time()
## before any calculations or formatting are performed
