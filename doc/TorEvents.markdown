# Tor Events used by PrivCount

PrivCount obtains its Tor usage data via Tor Control Events. These events have
been implemented specifically for PrivCount. PrivCount also uses some other
Controller interfaces.

## PrivCount Overview

### Initialisation

1. PrivCount authenticates to the Control Port (PROTOCOLINFO, AUTHENTICATE),
   using one of the following methods:
   * SAFECOOKIE (AUTHCHALLENGE)
   * HASHEDPASSWORD
   * NULL (if neither other method is available, and tor offers NULL
     authentication)

2. PrivCount discovers some relay information (GETINFO, GETCONF)

### Collection

1. PrivCount waits for the collection round to start
2. PrivCount turns on the tor PrivCount code (SETCONF EnablePrivCount 1)
3. PrivCount turns on the tor events required for the collection round
   (SETEVENTS PRIVCOUNT_...)
4. Tor starts sending events as they occur, and PrivCount processes these
   events

### Cleanup

1. PrivCount waits for the collection round to stop
2. PrivCount turns off EnablePrivCount and all tor events (SETCONF,
   SETEVENTS)

## Tor Relay Roles

The information available to a Tor Relay depends on the role that relay plays
in the data transfer. Relays can determine their role in the data transfer
based on the commands they receive.

Role     |  Connection | Circuit | Stream | Cell | Bytes  | Additional
---------|-------------|---------|--------|------|--------|-----------------
Guard~   | Y           | Y       | N/E    | Y    | N/C/E& | Client IP~
Bridge   | Y           | Y       | N/E    | Y    | N/C/E& | Client IP~
Middle   | N/C         | N/C     | N/E    | N/C  | N/C/E& |
Exit     | Y           | Y       | Y      | Y    | Y      | DNS^
DirPort  | N/C         | N/A     | N/A    | N/A  | N/C    | URL*, Client IP$
BEGINDIR | N/C         | N/C     | N/C    | N/C  | N/C    | URL*, Client IP$
HSDir    | N/C         | N/C     | N/C    | N/C  | N/C    | Onion Address+
Intro    | Y           | Y       | N/E    | Y    | N/C/E& | Service Keys+
Rend     | Y           | Y       | N/C    | Y    | N/C/E& |
Client@  | N/C         | N/C     | N/C    | N/C  | N/C    | DNS^

Usage:
* Y: Available and Collected
* N/C: Available, but not Collected (We choose not to collect this)
* N/E: Available, but Encrypted (The relay does not have the keys needed to
       decrypt this)
* N/A: Not Applicable (The data does not exist)

Notes:
* \~ "Guard" relays can be connected to clients, or Bridge relays, or other
     relays that aren't in the consensus. Other relays authenticate using RSA
     and ed25519 keys, bridges and clients do not, and can not be
     distinguished.  
* \$ Most Directory requests are performed using a direct connection from the
     client, others are performed using a 3-hop path.  
* \^ Application protocols also leak any unencrypted (meta)data to Exit relays
     and Tor Clients.  
* \* Directory requests contain information about the documents being
     downloaded. Clients request all relay documents, but fetch hidden service
     descriptors as-needed.  
* \+ HSDirs handle hidden service descriptor uploads and downloads over
     BEGINDIR. The service keys can be matched with a hidden service
     descriptor if the onion address is known. Next-generation (v3) hidden
     service descriptors can only be decrypted if the onion address is already
     known. Clients always perform HSDir uploads and downloads over a 3-hop
     connection.  
* \& This role sees encrypted cells, including headers and padding, and can
     not distinguish overheads from content.  
* \@ Onion services connect to the tor network as clients. Relays can also
     perform client activities, like fetching a consensus.   

When relays are relaying cells on a circuit, they can only see that the cell
is a RELAY (or RELAY_EARLY) cell. Everything else is encrypted. (Each relay
maintains a separate mapping that tells it where to forward RELAY cells
received on a particular circuit.)

PrivCount does not currently have a "cell" event. Multiple cells may be
included in each "bytes" event.

## PrivCount Events

PrivCount implements the following events, listed in the typical order they
would occur for a single client connection.

PrivCount tries to capture all non-directory Tor network traffic for its
traffic modelling. Some other events are issued selectively based on the type
of traffic: this is a work in progress.

### PRIVCOUNT_DNS_RESOLVED

This event is sent when an exit receives a client request, including:
* both connect and resolve requests,
* for DNS names, and IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
* whether the DNS name is in Tor's local DNS cache or not,
* with limited checks on whether the address is a valid DNS name or IP address.  
  (Tor clients and Tor Exits perform some sanity checks before sending an
  address for resolution).

There is *no* filtering of unsuccessful DNS hostname lookups. However,
internal tor network requests (such as directory and onion service requests)
do not use DNS resolution, so they do not trigger this event.

The DNS event is *not* used by any PrivCount counters, but was used as part of
PrivEx's censorship blacklist measurements.

It includes the following fields:
* Channel ID
* Circuit ID
* Address requested by client (hostname or IPv4 or IPv6)

It has the following known issues:
* There is no indication in the event whether the request was successful or
  not, so this event can not be used to count client connections (only client
  requests)  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/184
* The resolved address is not included in the event  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/184
* The time is not included in the event  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/187
* These events include relay DirPort self-checks to their own IPv4 addresses  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/188

### PRIVCOUNT_STREAM_BYTES_TRANSFERRED

This event is sent when tor reads or writes data from a remote exit stream.

Internal tor network requests (such as onion service requests) and directory
requests do not trigger this event: they are filtered out on the tor side.
Zero reads and writes do not trigger this event. Tor also performs some checks
before reading or writing that may cause this event not to be sent.

Relay DirPort self-checks by remote relays do trigger this event, even though
they are not client traffic. The traffic and connections are
negligible compared with all tor network traffic, but may be significant for
small counters that include IPv4 ports 80 or 9030.

Some tor-side filtering of this event may be necessary for performance
reasons: this event is the most frequent event that tor sends to PrivCount.

The bytes event is used by the PrivCount traffic model counters. (Other
counters that report bytes use the same data as this event, but aggregate it,
and send the totals with the END event.)

It includes the following fields:
* Channel ID (if the OR channel has not been cleared)
* Circuit ID (if there is a corresponding OR circuit)
* Stream ID
* Is Outbound Flag
* Number of Bytes
* Current Timestamp

It has the following known issues:
* This event includes relay DirPort self-checks to their own IPv4 addresses  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/188
* The channel and circuit fields in this event may be missing in some cases  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/193

### PRIVCOUNT_STREAM_ENDED

This event is sent when tor closes a remote exit stream.

Internal tor network requests (such as onion service requests) and directory
requests do not trigger this event: they are filtered out on the tor side.

Relay DirPort self-checks by remote relays do trigger this event, even though
they are not client traffic. The self-testing traffic and connections are
negligible compared with all tor network traffic, but may be significant for
small counters that include IPv4 ports 80 or 9030.

The end stream event is used by the PrivCount stream, circuit stream, and
circuit activity counters.

It includes the following fields:
* Channel ID (if the OR channel has not been cleared)
* Circuit ID (if there is a corresponding OR circuit)
* Stream ID
* Remote Port
* Total Number of Bytes Read
* Total Number of Bytes Written
* Connection Creation Timestamp
* Current Timestamp

It has the following known issues:
* This event includes relay DirPort self-checks to their own IPv4 addresses  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/188
* The channel and circuit fields in this event may be missing in some cases  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/193

### PRIVCOUNT_CIRCUIT_ENDED

This event is sent when tor closes a remote exit circuit.

Internal tor network requests (such as onion service requests) and directory
requests do not trigger this event: they are filtered out on the tor side.
Unused circuits are also filtered out.

Relay DirPort self-checks by remote relays do trigger this event, even though
they are not client traffic. The self-testing traffic and connections are
negligible compared with all tor network traffic, but may be significant for
small counters that include IPv4 ports 80 or 9030.

The circuit ended event is used by the PrivCount circuit, circuit stream, and
circuit activity counters.

It includes the following fields:
* Channel ID (if the OR channel has not been cleared)
* Circuit ID
* Total Number of Cells In (Read)
* Total Number of Cells Out (Written)
* Total Number of DNS Bytes Read
* Total Number of DNS Bytes Written
* Total Number of Exit Bytes Read
* Total Number of Exit Bytes Written
* Circuit Creation Timestamp
* Current Timestamp
* Previous Hop Remote IP Address
* Previous Hop Is Client Flag
* Previous Hop Is Relay Flag
* Next Hop Remote IP Address
* Next Hop Is Edge Flag
* Next Hop Is Relay Flag

It has the following known issues:
* This event includes relay DirPort self-checks to their own IPv4 addresses  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/188
* The channel field in this event may be missing in some cases  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/193
* If a Remote IP Address is missing, 0.0.0.0 is used as a placeholder  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/196

### PRIVCOUNT_CONNECTION_ENDED

This event is sent when tor closes a remote OR connection.

Internal tor network requests (such as onion service requests) trigger this
event.

Relay DirPort self-checks by remote relays also trigger this event, even
though they are not client traffic. There are very few self-testing
connections compared with all tor network traffic.

Circuits for these requests are multiplexed over connections from the client
or other relays, so they almost always use existing connections.

Client directory requests do not trigger this event: they are filtered out on
the tor side. (Clients make direct connections for most BEGINDIR requests, so
excluding them makes connection counts more accurate.)

The connection ended event is used by the PrivCount connection and connection
lifetime counters.

It includes the following fields:
* Channel ID (if the OR channel has not been cleared)
* Connection Creation Timestamp
* Current Timestamp
* Remote IP Address
* Remote Is Client Flag
* Remote Is Relay Flag

It has the following known issues:
* This event includes relay DirPort self-checks to their own IPv4 addresses  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/188
* The channel field in this event may be missing in some cases  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/193
* If a Remote IP Address is missing, 0.0.0.0 is used as a placeholder  
  https://github.com/privcount/privcount/issues/196

## PrivCount Event Field Detail

### Channel ID

An unsigned 64-bit unique identifier of a tor channel. This is a persistent,
globally unique identifier for the life of the tor process.

### Circuit ID

An unsigned 32-bit unique identifier of a circuit on a particular OR connection
(channel).

### Stream ID
An unsigned 16-bit unique identifier of a stream on a particular circuit.

### Address
A string that represents the location of a remote site on the Internet. This
may be a hostname, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address.

### Port
An unsigned 16-bit number that represents the port of a remote site on the
Internet.

### Number of Cells
An unsigned 64-bit count of cells in (read) or out (written).

### Number of Bytes
An unsigned 64-bit count of bytes read or written. This byte count uses
saturating arithmetic: values that exceed the maximum are reported as the
maximum value.

### Timestamp
The current unix epoch time (UTC) in seconds, to 6 decimal places. The
underlying resolution depends on the operating system.

### Is Outbound Flag
A numeric boolean flag: 1 for writes, 0 for reads.

### Is Client Flag
A numeric boolean flag.
True (1) if:
* the remote side used a CREATE_FAST handshake to initiate this connection, or
* the remote side did not perform peer authentication.
False (0) if:
* the remote side used another kind of handshake, or
* the remote side performed peer authentication, or
* the circuit is missing.

### Is Edge Flag
A numeric boolean flag.
True (1) if:
* the edge connection is an exit connection, or
* any stream or pending stream on the circuit is an exit connection, or
* there are no streams and no next channel.
False (0) if:
* the circuit is an origin circuit,
* all streams are non-exit connections,
* the next channel is connected to a relay,
* the circuit and connection are both missing.

### Is Relay Flag
A numeric boolean flag: 1 if the remote side is a relay in the latest consensus
that this relay has. (Clients with different consensuses may ask to extend to
relays not in this relay's consensus.) 0 if it is not in the consensus. 0 if
the channel is missing.
