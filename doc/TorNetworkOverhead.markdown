# Tor Network Overhead

The Tor network transfers TCP streams. Exits connect Client streams to
arbitrary remote Internet services, and Hidden Services connect Client streams
to a particular service, which may or may not be Internet-accessible.

The Tor network also has the following overheads:

## Directory

Tor's directory documents are used by clients to locate relays and build
circuits.

### Relay Descriptor Uploads

Tor relays upload their descriptors to the directory authorities via a direct
HTTP POST.

### Voting and Consensus Signatures

Tor directory authorities vote and sign consensuses every hour via a direct
HTTP POST.

### Directory Downloads

Relays and clients download directory documents from directory mirrors, either
over a one-hop BEGINDIR connection, or an unencrypted HTTP GET via the DirPort.

### Bandwidth Authorities

Bandwidth authorities build 2-hop paths through a relay and an exit, and check
the speed of the connection.

## Client

### Preemptive Circuits

Clients keep a small number of circuits open to speed up application requests.

## Relay

### ORPort Self-Checks

Relays create a 2-hop path to their own ORPort, and wait until they receive
a remote connection.

### ORPort Bandwidth Checks

Relays create a 2-hop path to their own ORPort, and transfer cells to measure
their own bandwidth.

### DirPort Self-Checks

Directory mirrors create a 3-hop path to their own DirPort, and download their
own descriptor.

## Onion Routing

### Authentication

Tor sends CERTS and AUTH* cells to authenticate to relays.

### Metadata

Tor sends VERSIONS and NETINFO cells.

### Circuit Management

Tor sends CREATE* and DESTROY cells to manage circuits.

### Data Flow Management

Tor sends SENDME cells to request more data.

### Padding

Tor automatically drops [V]PADDING cells: upcoming versions of tor may send
these cells by default. Tor also drops RELAY_DROP cells.

### Data Cell Overhead

Each cell contains a variable-length header depending on the cell type.
RELAY_DATA cells typically have 16 bytes of overhead (out of 514 bytes).

## Exit

### DNS Resolution

Exits perform DNS resolution on hostnames supplied by clients. CONNECT requests
connect the stream to the remote server. RESOLVE requests return the IP address
to the client.

### Exit Mapping

Tor runs a service which connects to every exit and discovers its exit IP
addresses.
